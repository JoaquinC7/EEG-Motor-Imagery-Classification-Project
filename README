EEG Motor Imaging Classification Project:

Objective:
The goal of this project is to take open source data from the BCI Competition N- Dataset 2a, sample, filter, and apply machine learning to learn about and classify EEG-acquisitioned motor neural signals between imagined left hand and right hand movement. 

Dataset:
BCI Competition IV - Dataset 2a
